sed 's/replace_it/replace_this/' <filename>
    SED TIP: if you find editing something that has
    bunch of backshalshes like and you are getting annoyed to 
    escape all the characters
        -> you can acctually use any character as a delemeter just make sure
           the character is not there in your text
           EG: sed 's/https:\/\/example.com/https:\/\/sailor.org/' template.yaml
               (or) 
               sed 's#https://example.com#https//sailor.org#' template.yaml

awk :
    Perfect tool to extract the data out of 
    EG: awk -F '\t' '{print $3 " | " $4}'   quotes.csv

tail -f log

echo 'hello,world' | sed 's/world/universe/'

ls | xargs figlet -f digital
    xarge take the content that you give it and split it into chunks and for each chunk
    it will pass it as argument for each command you specify

du -sh  ->prints the size of the directory

ls | grep 'l' | xargs du -sh

--------------using subshell

echo "my current directory is : $(pwd)"

-----redirection
ls --help > ls-help.txt
>> will append or it creates if it doesn't

tr 'a-z' 'A-z' < template.yaml [ NOT UNDERSTOOD THIS ]

fzf

compgen -c --> to list all the command s | we have complete -C in fish

compgen -c | fzf | xargs man *** -- when you create something like this you can
                                    create aliases like
                                    alias fman="campgen -c | fzf | xargs man"
                                    dump this into your config file in your shell 


==> this is great when working with the kubernates
kubectl get pds -A --no-headers | fzf  awk '{print $2,$1}' | xargs -n 2 sh -c 'kubectl describe pod $0 -n $1'

--finding the biggest files and the directories in the given path
du -ah .  | sort -hr | head -n 10


##if you find yourself running out of tomany node projects 
find . -name 'node_modules' -type d | xargs du -sh  | sort -hr |
fzf -m --header "Select which ones to delete" --preview 'cat $(direname {})/package.json'|
awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r rm -rf

    we use find to grab all the nodemodules starting at this subtree then we use
    du with xargs to find what is the size of the each directory is |
    then we sort it based on the size in reverse order |
    casted into fuzzy find
